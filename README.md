- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnorZaken
- I’m interested in solving requests. No really, when I receieve a non-trivial request meant to satisfy a clear need is when I get motivated to work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, and playing around with the recent C# 9 additions (records are nice!). Plan to look at Kotlin and Python later.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on indie game projects, because I've been mening to do another game for a long time, but going solo is a bit risky.
Of course I don't work on games only, but my other project ideas are a bit easier to handle solo...
- 📫 How to reach me ..? LinkedIn would probably be the easiest: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicklas-damgren-446699146/
